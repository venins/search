In the olden days, it was common practice in medieval England for kings to develop and maintain an army of
knights who would fight for the king to death. The knights were selected from a group of supremely talented
fighters known for their swordsmanship and marksmanship. The king or chieftian would then spend a lot of
his finances to maintain this army of knights who would die to defend his honour.
 
It was a common practice to also have sporting fights where two knights would face each other holding very
long, unwieldy spears while covered from head to toe in metallic armour. This practice, which often resulted
in fatal accidents was called "jousting".
